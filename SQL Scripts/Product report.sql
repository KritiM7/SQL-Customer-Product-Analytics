/* Product Report

Purpose:
- This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
- total orders
- total sales
- total quantity sold
- total customers (unique)
- lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
- recency (months since last sale)
- average order revenue (AOR)
- average monthly revenue */
